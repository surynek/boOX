=======================================================

An experimental package for solving various problems
related to artificial intelligence.

-------------------------------------------------------


The current release of the package (version 0-104) includes
implementations of optimal solvers for various item
relocation problems. Solvers built upon conflict-based
search (CBS) and solvers based on satisfiability modulo
theories (SMT) are implemented.

The CBS and SMT solver has been originally developed for a
multi-agent path finding problem (MAPF). But we gradually
added modifications so the package now includes solvers
for:

  - multi-agent path finding (MAPF)
  - token swapping (TSWAP)
  - token rotation (TROT)
  - token permutation (TPERM)

Please see my papers for details of individual problems.


Compilation
-----------

./config-release
make optimized


Problem Solving
---------------

The presented package consists of several command line tools:

mapf_solver_boOX - an optimal MAPF solver
swap_solver_boOX - an optimal TSWAP solver
rota_solver_boOX - an optimal TROT solver
perm_solver_boOX - an optimal TPERM solver

All above programs can be found in /src/main directory. Each
program has a command line option --algorithm=<alg> by which
the user can switch between solving by CBS (--algorithm=cbs)
and solving by SMT (--algorithm=smtcbs).

Item relocation instances can be generated by following
programs located in the same directory:

gridgen_boOX   - instances on 4-regular grids
randgen_boOX   - instances on random graphs
cliquegen_boOX - instances on clique graphs
pathgen_boOX   - instances on path graphs
stargen_boOX   - instances on star graphs

Simple command line help is provided by each tool
when invoked with the --help option.

The following example shows how to run the solver:

./tosolver_boOX --output-file=solution.txt --input-file=clique_07_t07.tok --algorithm=smtcbs

Please enjoy you problem solving...
